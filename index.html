						<h2>History</h2>
						<p>The first competitive hockey match played in the United States was a contest between Hopkins and Yale in Baltimore on February 1st, 1896. It was a stubborn and hard fought duel that ended in a 2 - 2 tie. The University's 1895 - 96 team was
							a mix of 11 dedicated graduate students and undergrads representing all university divisions, a common practice back then. The university was small and since graduate students outnumbered the undergrads three-to-one, this University-wide
							camaraderie was born out of necessity.</p>
						<p>Samuel Alfred Mitchell, an astronomy graduate student, was team captain and played second defense. G. B. Scholl, a second-year undergraduate, played goal in addition to serving as the team manager and treasurer. The team disbanded at the
							end of the 1897 - 98 academic year citing transportation problems, disagreements between the rink management and the teams, and the lack of student support as the main causes. There was a 90-year hiatus before competitive ice hockey would
							pick up again at Hopkins. But today, hockey players at Hopkins satisfy their interest in the sport by playing for the University's club team. Listed below you will find information on the team dating as far back as we have records for. We
							don't have much historical information, so if you played for one of these teams, please let us know the details!</p>
